Description

The Pneumonia Classifier is a web application designed to classify X-ray images and determine whether a person has pneumonia or not. This tool utilizes a deep learning model trained on medical X-ray images to assist in diagnosing pneumonia based on visual patterns in the images.

Features

Upload X-ray Image: Users can upload an X-ray image of the chest for analysis.
Classification: The app processes the uploaded image using a pre-trained model to predict whether the image indicates the presence of pneumonia.
Result: Provides a clear classification result indicating whether pneumonia is detected or not.
User-Friendly Interface: The application is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a straightforward upload and result display process.
Model Overview
The Pneumonia Classifier uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images to distinguish between images with and without pneumonia. The model is capable of:

Detecting signs of pneumonia from X-ray images.

Providing accurate results based on visual features in the images.
Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images. If you have specific dataset information or links, you can include them here.

How to Use

Upload Image: Click on the upload button to select an X-ray image from your device.
View Result: The app will classify the image and display whether pneumonia is detected or not based on the analysis.
